In our Software Engineering Post-Work, I did an Algorithm Self Assessment - this one is to find the largest Subarray Sum out of an array of integers. While I work on algorithms frequently, it’s nice to be able to use these as things to “push” onto my GitHub, and as a chance to use the lovely Learn IDE.

During my Skilled interview for Ruby, I spoke with my interviewer about the importance of algorithms, and continued learning. Some people choose to learn more with leetcode or coderbyte, or any of the multiple online resources where one could learn more about the coding “basics”.

The importance of knowing these algorithms are only overshadowed by this question - why are they at the forefront of many job interviews?

The best argument I have seen for why algorithms make up a huge chunk of technical interviews is because they tend to be seen as either the basics or the stepping-stones of whatever code language you’re using. I’ve also seen good rebuttals that algorithms are not at the core of what makes a coder great (and, to that point, even the best coders use Google to help themselves). 

Isn't a better interview style to actually show the interviewee what the position entails? Algorithm tests do little more than test the memory of an interviewee, but not the actual coding expertise.

I also went over a Recursion lab, an Insertion Sort lab, a Merge Sort lab, and started going into the Data Structures with a Linked List lab. No matter your opinion on /why/ algorithms are used in interviews, we can all agree that it’s easier to keep up on your knowledge than it is to consistently be relearning every time an interview or coding opportunity comes around. Having resources from Flatiron still at my fingertips, even after graduating, has made it a lot easier.
