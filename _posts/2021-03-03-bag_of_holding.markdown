My final project for Flatiron School is called Bag Of Holding, thus ending my schooling here the same way I started - with a Dungeons and Dragons reference. In D&D terms, a bag of holding is a bag that is much larger on the inside than it seems, and is able to hold much more than the average satchel or backpack.

This application allows a user to track their characters, as well track their characters bags. Throughout my months at Flatiron, I’ve done different iterations of D&D apps. As a player (and user), I’ve always found it important to have a way of tracking my inventory that is both simple and consistent. Papers are so easily lost, and note apps usually never cut it. Therefore, Bag Of Holding takes the place of these unreliable ways, and lets the user keep everything in one place.

The application is done in a React.js/Redux.js frontend and a Ruby on Rails backend. Rails, at this point, feels almost instinctual. As far as Ruby went, I needed to look up very little, and I feel that my overall confidence lets this application shine as a true winner. Using React.js/Redux.js was intimidating at first, but my knowledge of vanilla Javascript helped ease the way into comfort with these new systems.

My goal is to continue adding on to this application as time goes by - adding users, worlds, and hopefully a way to integrate the D&D API into the project itself. It’s exciting to have a project that can just keep getting bigger and better, the more I learn and grow with my coding skills. Especially with this being the end of my Flatiron School career, it’s nice to continue having something to work on that I’m already proud of.

While it’s always bittersweet to end a journey, I am looking forward to new adventures, and - of course - a new job.
