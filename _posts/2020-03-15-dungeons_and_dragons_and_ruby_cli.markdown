For my Ruby CLI project, I chose a subject near and dear to my heart: Dungeons and Dragons.

In this CLI, you can search the name of a monster (like an acolyte or a frog) and then you can choose whether you want additional information (name, type, size, alignment, armor class, challenge rating), or if you would like to start over, or exit the CLI. My favorite part of D&D has always been the amount of detail there was on each creature, and it fit in well with the project requirements. The first time I typed in the information, and got a response that wasn’t an error code? It felt like magic!

I was surprised how many open source API’s there were for DND (let alone how many there are, period), and after checking out the competition, I went with the dnd5eapi.co API. This API had the most simple layout for breaking down the data (into things like size, type, and of course, name). I used restclient and JSON as the actual ‘scraper’ - it was the suggested/mandatory run method through this particular API, which caused some confusion at first. I was able to learn how the different ‘scrape methods’ could be used depending on any parts of the code given.

This project went through three iterations: the first two were built before I really ‘got’ API’s, and so I started fresh, as I wanted to show off my new information in a way that also made me excited to (re)write all of the code. I didn’t have as much frustration as I feel I had had in past projects through schooling - I think I’ve just been so happy to know what I am supposed to know!

The main thing I took from this project (other than some newly instilled pride), is how important it is to have a gameplan going into it. While I did have some notes on what I wanted to do, if I were to completely start over from when I first started the project, I would make sure I had all my information correct (as it would save me time by the end).

While completing homework is nice, it was invigorating to test what I can do on my own - and, it was a good lesson in why starting early is so important. Even though I started on day ‘zero’, I was still able to add things up until the last minute - I met with Juan three times as well, to walk me through some of the difficulties I couldn’t figure out how to do through google examples. Starting the project three times felt like wasted time at first, however, I do believe a start-over can be just as - or, more - effective than digging my heels in, and bulldozing my way through. All in all, I’m proud of this project, and more so, the time and effort I have put in.

(I have the remnants of the other two Ruby CLI projects on my github as well, both named (aptly) along the lines of Ruby CLI Project.)
