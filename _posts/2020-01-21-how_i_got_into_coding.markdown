My background up to this point has been in liberal arts - an emphasis on stand up comedy and fine art. I’ve spent years being critiqued (and, of course, doing critiques) of rushed charcoal gesture drawings, photorealistic oil paintings of the Irish glades, and logos of every store and shop imaginable. Throughout the four years of college I attended I realized an important lesson - there is power in doing things incorrectly.

Art is subjective - even in college classes, students were graded on how many hours one worked, instead of any measurable skills. Afterall, how does one grade something that has no real right or wrong? But, if you miss a bracket, or enter the wrong variable, it /is/ incorrect. There’s freedom in knowing things for certain. And, because of that, there’s some invigorating about getting it correct.

While I still am passionate about art and comedy, I’ve realized that staking a career on something that is so fluid and hard to pinpoint, is not for me. Code can be creative, and inspiring, and a way of controlling systems. As much as I like a positive response from an art critique, I love the feeling of when a coding concept finally clicks, and I get to make something out of, very literally, nothing. 

I started coding before I really knew what it was - messing around with the HTML on tumblr, trying to learn how to center all of the anime screenshots on my page. Since those days in middle school, I evolved into learning bits and pieces of other languages. Bits of CSS, Javascript, and more recently, a little bit of Python. Then, a couple months ago, I decided to take the plunge and enroll in Flatiron School. I’m excited to delve into Ruby and other languages, and really learn how to be an effective Software Engineer.
