The projects I have completed so far for my portfolio have revolved around the popular tabletop roleplaying game known as Dungeons and Dragons. Within the series there are countless books and spinoffs ranging from the first to the most current fifth-edition, lots of live-action podcasts with awe-inspiring fanbases, and a place inside of many people's hearts.

The massive amount of information out there, and the passion that can be directed towards it, inspired me to create a range of projects that can adequately use what is in front of me. I am grateful that the information has been tied up in a neat open-source API (both dnd5e and open5e), and has made my job much easier. This game has a wide array of information about dozens of topics - whether it be types of monsters, ranges of skills, or everything you would ever need to know about a barbarian. 

The first project I did, where I made a CLI application that can tell you about any monster in the 5e Manual, got me used to requesting information from an API to spit out into the application. In my second project, I created a Sinatra application where users can create accounts or sign in, in order to document the items their D&D characters have been gifted. The layout of this application is what I am going to build upon in order to create a site in Rails, where users will be able to both look up the information needed from the API, and be able to store it all in one place.

One of the important things I have learned about creating a new project is that it is helpful to have a topic that, while easy to contain into listed categories, has the potential to become a bigger-scale application. Even in our project guidelines, we are told to make no little plans - and while it can seem like a good idea to give yourself a strong limit on what your project can do, it also could box you in a corner whenever you decide to expand.

It’s also nice to have a lineup of projects where I am able to see my progression from one application to another. While the homework is very useful and allows us to test our knowledge on the material, it’s hard to beat a project that we have to see through till the end. There is always a huge sense of pride after finishing a successful code review or the first time your code passes. While it isn’t quite like the more traditional visual arts such as painting, coding is still an art in it’s own right. Being able to add another piece to our official portfolios is also very helpful.

Dungeons and Dragons, like coding, works best when you know the rules - and, when you know how to use them correctly. Just like any application or D&D game, you won’t do well if you don’t know what you’re going into. However, you also should have the imagination to create something special.
