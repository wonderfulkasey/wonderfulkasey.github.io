This week, I decided to go a bit outside of my comfort zone, and figure out how to use Figma. 
Figma is a UX/UI design software, built for creating mockups of websites and software. However, there are a lot of other things one could use it for - in my example above, I made a simple graphic that is sized for a Twitter post. (For me, one of the most useful features is the fact you can pick ‘frames’ in the exact size of what you are going to use the graphic for. For example: you can pick by website resolution, mobile resolution, tablet resolution, etc.)

As somebody with a history of design experience, it felt good to go back to my roots this way, and to create something more on the ‘artsy’ side. I’ve always been interested in website design - I started with creating tumblr pages in middle school, and now I’m able to go at it as someone with more experience with ‘correct’ ways to make a page. 

Accessibility is also needed now more than ever, which is one of my favorite parts of UX/UI design. Part of this includes choosing color palettes (nothing too harsh, and preferably something that is distinct enough to see if color-blind), font size and type (for people who can’t see well or have reading impairments, like dyslexia), to the size of buttons themselves (tiny buttons on web formats do not translate well to tiny buttons on mobile formats).

By creating these mockups, a UX/UI designer can create a usable website that is both easy to use and fun to look at. A UX/UI designer might also pass this design along to a coder (like me!) to create the actual page, so that they do not need to pick and design the entire site from scratch.
