Abraham Lincoln (or, some smart person who was incorrectly attributed) once said: “Give me six hours to chop down a tree and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe.” 

When I first heard this quote a few years ago, I thought that I really knew what it meant - plan a lot, then get stuff done. However, the further I dive into programming, the more important it becomes that I plan. And not just plan - I have to arm myself to the teeth with deadlines, outlines, and a planner as thick as any old encyclopedia. It feels like I have had to relearn what planning even means, and how to get the most out of it.

It seems to boil down to this - you have to give yourself as much room to succeed as possible, in a way that seems like too much work at the beginning. For example, I restarted this particular project almost a half dozen times - and, while exhausting and demotivating, it was the best learning I think I could have given myself. Although , I would have saved hours of frustration by simply writing down all my steps. It feels counterproductive to spend that much time on a piece of programming that wasn’t even code, but it ended up being the most important step I would end up doing.

While drawing up the diagrams online about how my views and models and controllers would end up interacting were helpful, nothing beats an old school to-do list. Below is a very, very conservative list of steps I would be doing (have done?):

1- Generate new Rails app. 2) CD into new app. 3) Save initial commit. 4) Add Devise, Omniauth, and Cancancan gems to gemfile. 5) Bundle install. 6) Commit add gems. 7) Devise new user. 8) Commit. 9) Devise new views. 10) Commit. 

Now, of course this isn’t a fool-proof list - I still have dozens of steps left, including migrating all the new files, adding my own views, connecting everything together in the routes page to list a few - but it helps keep me on track. This list comes with it’s own lessons too - commit more often than you believe you need to, make a lot of little goals so you stay motivated throughout the project, and make sure you don’t try to go to step eight when you’re not even done with step three. Lists like these become even more important the harder the project is, as one mistake could set you back many, many hours or days of work.

Overall, the Rails project went well. It was very intimidating in the beginning, even though I’ve just done over a month’s worth of learning. Being able to sign into my app with Github, as well as adding the Devise gem, really made this project feel real to me in a way that the others didn’t quite feel like. This project really made me feel like I’m on my way to become a real life, real deal software engineer.
