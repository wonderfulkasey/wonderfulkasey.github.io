My next project is creating a site that lists art improvement resources - from videos to blogs to paid classes. I know that one of the hardest parts of improving at any skill is knowing what is needed to learn. (Which, in my case, has been true for both art and software development!)

I have currently created the controllers and models for two sections (Basics and Types). I intend the Basics to - as one might guess - list the most basic resources for art improvement. The Types will be used to show more specificity - does someone want to improve at figure drawing, oil painting, perspective? This will be the place to look.

I have also done the basic routes (using resources), and a long-term goal would be to add some sort of ‘checklist’ function and a user login, so that a user could ‘check off’ what they’ve already done. Getting the actual list of resources is my current project, though I’ve done stuff like that before in order to create a resource source for others. Now it’s time to update it!

The goal of this website is to combine two things I’m already passionate about - Rails and art improvement. While I am on the job search, it’s important for me to stay up to date (and also improve!) on my code knowledge, so having passion projects are a great way to stay involved in the community. I am also able to collect resources for art improvement, and give back to the art community that I’ve learned so much from.

Within the upcoming weeks I hope to have a more polished looking site, as well as be able to deploy it on Heroku or some equivalent application.
