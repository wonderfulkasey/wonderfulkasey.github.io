For my Sinatra project, I built the ‘Haversack App’ - an application that somebody could use to keep track of their items in the popular roleplaying game, Dungeons and Dragons. The main focus of this application is that a user should be able to create, edit, and delete items, while being able to store information about the item. Therefore, in every item class the user is able to say the title of the item, what character the item belongs to, a short description of the item, and the date on which it was received. 

While sinatra isn’t a very difficult language to learn, since we already went over the base Ruby that we would use, it was harder to find information or help about it. The most popular way to work with Ruby seems to be through working on Rails, and if you were to google a question about Sinatra, you’d have to comb through the other resources to find Sinatra-specific help. Using Sinatra also had me get used to a sort of “code within the code” type of work - using the terminal to create and then migrate the migrates, and using it to create the schema file. 

I’ve been at Flatiron School for almost four months (with a couple months spent before that going through the pre-work), and I am still amazed whenever I get to see a project come together in the way I planned. That is not to say that there weren’t issues that I had to work through - migrations didn’t come quickly to me in the beginning, though now I have a better handle on them. I also am able to utilize other sources of help - other coders, my main teacher Juan, and all of the communities through google that offer words of wisdom.

I feel as a student that I can get lost in the homework. Though the homework is useful and needed in order to learn, having a project that I control completely helps me really sink my teeth into the material. It also gives a sort of bigger picture to look at, as it is more similar to what we would be doing at our potential jobs. It was also cool using the CSS to create a nicer looking page, even if it is still quite simple, and it was a nice way to end the application project. I could see how someone could get stuck in it, and not do the core work out of fear or procrastination.

For my last project, I created a ruby gem that would be able to tell you about the monsters within the world of the fifth edition D&D. And, my goal for my next project - in which I build an application using Ruby on Rails - I would like to incorporate my previous two projects, to create a program that lets the user both look up information (from the D&D API used in my first project) and a more finished version of my rough layout from this project.
